# The underlying elements of a review : predicting beer taste without the review.

Abstract: 

This [study](http://i.stanford.edu/~julian/pdfs/icdm2012.pdf) analysed the feelings of beer drinkers through their reviews and linked them to the corresponding user rating of a beer. An extent of this analysis is to explore the external parameters of the reviews and seek connections with the actual ratings. By external parameters, we mean focusing on the features of a review that do not have an obvious link with the rating. These can be the date at which the review was published, the nationality of the reviewer or even the length of the review. This meta data will then be conceived and processed to feed different Machine Learning algorithms. We will use linear regression as well as logistic regression and a ReLU neural network to unveil the possible hidden ties in the dataset. The main intention is to reveal a concealed link between the liking of a beer and special review features.
